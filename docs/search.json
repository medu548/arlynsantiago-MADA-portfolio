    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata2, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.\n76  That's right. Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But Zuko misunderstood.  When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general.  Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.  Zuko would have to duel his own father.\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I looked away.\n79                                                                                                                                                                             It was no accident.

To do so, we need to first combine them into one dataframe with labels to differentiate which values belong to each model. The base code was generated with help from Microsoft Copilot in Precise mode and modified to the specifics of the set.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Add model labels\ndc5_lm2_pred &lt;- dc5_lm2_pred %&gt;% mutate(model = \"Model 1\")\ndc5_lm3_pred &lt;- dc5_lm3_pred %&gt;% mutate(model = \"Model 2\")\n\n# Add model label for null model\ntrain_null_pred &lt;- train_null %&gt;% \n  predict(train_data) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(train_data) %&gt;%\n  mutate(model = \"Null Model\")\n\n# Combine the null model data frame with the other models\ncombined_data &lt;- bind_rows(dc5_lm2_pred, dc5_lm3_pred, train_null_pred)\n\n# Rename the columns for clarity\nnames(combined_data)[names(combined_data) == \".pred\"] &lt;- \"Predicted\"\nnames(combined_data)[names(combined_data) == \"Y\"] &lt;- \"Observed\"\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Observed, y = Predicted, color = model)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Observed vs Predicted Values\", x = \"Observed\", y = \"Predicted\", color = \"Model\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that Model 1, which only used DOSE as a predictor, has 3 distinct horizontal lines. This would be due to the 3 different dose levels in the dataset; the lowest dose is at the bottom of the graph while the highest is at the top. The null model just cuts straight across the middle, which is to be expected since the “predicted” values are just copies of the observed ones. Model 2 looks the best, but isn’t perfect, as we can see some patterns in the distribution. We’ll now plot the residuals for Model 2 with help from Microsoft Copilot again.\n\n# Calculate residuals\ndc5_lm3_pred &lt;- dc5_lm3_pred %&gt;% mutate(Residuals = Y - .pred)\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(dc5_lm3_pred, aes(x = .pred, y = Residuals)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(min(dc5_lm3_pred$Residuals), abs(min(dc5_lm3_pred$Residuals)))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Predicted vs Residuals\", x = \"Predicted\", y = \"Residuals\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that there are more and higher negative values than our positive values. We’ll evaluate the uncertainty in the model by bootstrapping to further evaluate the weaknesses of our model.\n\n#Reset the random seed to the same value as before\nset.seed(rngseed)\n\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(rsample)\n\n# Create 100 bootstrap samples\nbootstraps &lt;- bootstraps(train_data, times = 100)\n\n# Initialize a data frame to store predictions\npredictions_df &lt;- data.frame()\n\n# Loop over each bootstrap sample\nfor(i in 1:100) {\n  # Extract the bootstrap sample\n  bootstrap_sample &lt;- analysis(bootstraps$splits[[i]])\n  \n  # Define a new model structure\n  model &lt;- linear_reg() %&gt;% \n    set_engine(\"lm\") %&gt;%\n    set_mode(\"regression\")\n  \n  # Fit the model to the bootstrap sample\n  fitted_model &lt;- model %&gt;% \n    fit(Y ~ ., data = bootstrap_sample)\n  \n  # Make predictions for the original training data\n  predictions &lt;- predict(fitted_model, new_data = train_data)\n  \n  # Store the predictions and observed values in the data frame\n  predictions_df &lt;- rbind(predictions_df, data.frame(Observed = train_data$Y, Predicted = predictions$.pred, Model = paste(\"Bootstrap\", i)))\n}\n\nNow that we’ve created bootstrap predictions and stored them, we can create some visuals.\n\n# Add observed values to the predictions data frame\npredictions_df$Observed &lt;- rep(train_data$Y, times = 100)\n\n# Compute the median and 89% confidence intervals\npreds &lt;- sapply(split(predictions_df$Predicted, predictions_df$Observed), function(x) quantile(x, c(0.055, 0.5, 0.945)))\n\n# Convert to a data frame\npreds_df &lt;- as.data.frame(t(preds))\nnames(preds_df) &lt;- c(\"Lower\", \"Median\", \"Upper\")\n\n# Add observed values to the data frame\npreds_df$Observed &lt;- as.numeric(rownames(preds_df))\n\n# Create the plot\nggplot(preds_df, aes(x = Observed)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = Median), color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Lower, ymax = Upper), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_point(aes(y = dc5_lm3_pred$.pred), color = \"black\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\") +\n  coord_equal() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Observed vs Predicted Values\", x = \"Observed\", y = \"Predicted\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe black dots are the predictions from the original model on the training data. The blue points are the median predictions from the bootstrap samples. The red lines are the 89% confidence intervals for the predictions. There’s a pretty large spread around the line, which indicates that there may be a good amount of error in the mode’ls predictions. Most of the black points tend to fall decently far above or below the line, indicating a poor fit from the original model on our training data. While some of the confidence interval lines indicate that a few of our median predictions are close to the line, the majority of them still fall above the line, indicating underpredicting.\nExercise 10: Part 3\nUsing the fit from Model 2 of the training data to make predictions of the test data.\n\n# Make predictions on training data \ntrain_pred &lt;- predict(dc5_lm3, new_data = train_data)\nprint(train_data)\n\n# A tibble: 90 × 6\n       Y  DOSE   AGE SEX      WT    HT\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 3004.  50      28 0      83.2  1.74\n 2 1347.  25      41 0      81    1.75\n 3 2772.  37.5    28 0      78.3  1.72\n 4 2028.  25      28 1      58.9  1.58\n 5 2353.  50      37 0      99.1  1.78\n 6  826.  25      30 0     105.   1.88\n 7 3866.  25      23 0      65.3  1.65\n 8 3126.  25      41 1      64.3  1.56\n 9 1108.  25      48 1      79.5  1.62\n10 2815.  37.5    26 0      84.5  1.77\n# ℹ 80 more rows\n\n# Make predictions on test data \ntest_pred &lt;- predict(dc5_lm3, new_data = test_data)\nprint(test_data)\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 6\n       Y  DOSE   AGE SEX      WT    HT\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2549.  25      46 0      83    1.78\n 2 2353.  37.5    43 1      64.4  1.56\n 3 2009.  37.5    19 0      86.1  1.91\n 4 2934.  37.5    46 0      71.2  1.67\n 5 2085.  37.5    37 0     102.   1.81\n 6 4835.  50      42 1      58    1.58\n 7 3514.  50      32 0      78.9  1.74\n 8 3906.  50      47 0      89.3  1.69\n 9 3105.  50      45 0      99.1  1.81\n10 2027.  25      20 0      80.5  1.88\n# ℹ 20 more rows\n\n# Create dataframe for final plot\n\ntrain_plot &lt;- data_frame(Observed = test_data$Y, Predicted = test_pred$.pred)\n\nWarning: `data_frame()` was deprecated in tibble 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `tibble()` instead.\n\ntest_plot &lt;- data_frame(Observed = test_data$Y, Predicted = test_pred$.pred)\nfinal_plot_data &lt;- bind_rows(train_plot, test_plot)\n\nggplot(final_plot_data, aes(x = Observed, y = Predicted, color = predictions_df)) +\n  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"purple\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Training\" = \"black\", \"Test\" = \"pink\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Observed Values\", y = \"Predicted Values\", title = \"Predicted vs Observed Values\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlim(0, 5000) +\n  ylim(0, 5000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it would appear that the model with all the variables as predictors (Model 2) has the better fit compared to the model only Dose was used as a predictor. This was initially determined by comparing the RMSEs between both models and including a null model as reference. Cross-validation was used to assess for how well a model will perform on data it hasn’t been trained on before. This was why the data was split into 75% of that data going into the train_data vector and the remaining 25% going into the test_data vector. Another method that was done to test our model was to use the Bootstrap methods with 100 samples. Model 2 performed relatively well when using bootstrap method. Lastly, the final part of this exercise was to fit the model for our test data.\nModel 2 with all variables as predictors seems to be the best model without much overfitting. There were some inconsistenices when measuring RMSE when using the Null model, perhaps it would be better to use other metrics such as MAE or R^2 in the future,"

Whichever approach you choose, add ample documentation/commentary so you and others can easily understand what’s going on and what is done."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/valeriasantiago/Documents/arlynsantiago-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(save_data_location, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Or you could have a subfolder for exploratory analysis, another for final analysis. The options are endless, choose whatever makes sense for your project.
